Welcome to the Thrush Band Image Editor.

I intend to use some various Github image manipulation scripts to fuck around with making some fun pictures.

All credit and inspiration goes to the original authors of these scripts:

https://github.com/satyarth/pixelsort.git
https://github.com/ucnv/pnglitch.git


HOW TO USE:
set your environment variables in the .env file.
basically, just put a variable called "input_path" and one called "output_path"
Then, set the values of these variables to be the folder with the unsorted images, and the folder of the sorted images, respectively
